	// Tabs.
	//
	// Hear me out.
	//
	// The main arguments FOR tabs are:
	//
	// - Everyone can specify their indentation preferences without affecting everyone else
	// - Less bytes (not a huge problem, but why complicate things)
	// - Faster to indent in ALL text editors (some people don't like magic IDEs)
	// - Faster to traverse in ALL text editors (see above)
	//
	// The main arguments AGAINST tabs are:
	//
	// - Tabs allow different widths
	// - Can't align
	// - Tabs are for tabular data
	// - Default of 8 space widths in browsers, including Github
	// - <insert language> doesn't allow hard tabs
	// - My text editor makes them really big/small/not what I want
	//
	// Here are the responses to the AGAINST items, in order:
	//
	// - That's a feature, not a bug
	// - Tabs for block indentation, spaces for alignment (see https://tabs.now.sh/#/Qix-/xopt/master/xopt.h)
	// - This isn't 1995, and nobody said they weren't
	// - Use .editorconfig (see https://github.com/Qix-/test-gh-editorconfig/blob/master/index.js and editorconfig.org)
	// - Use .editorconfig
	// - If your text editor lacks the ability to customize tab widths, find a new editor (might I suggest ViM?)
